Version 1.4b6
=============
- New toolbar which allows to perform actions on selected mails:
  * Delete the selected mails
  * Add the addresses of the selected mails to the addressbook
  * Block the senders of the selected mails
  
  The way, the toolbar looks like (with the radiobuttons) is ugly. But IE has a bad bug which left
  me no other coice. IE is not capable to handle <button type="select"> buttons correctly! The sent
  data is crap!
  
- Blocked sender feature! Select mails of senders you don't want to receive e-mails any more, select
  "Block" in the new toolbar (followed by Go...) and mails from this sender will be automatically put
  in the recycle bin.
  You can see your blocked senders in the addressbook
  
- General tip! Update to MySQL 3.23! I (and others) had problems with MySQL 3.22 when deleting mails.
  The DB crashed sometimes if one tried to delete many mails at once!
