The powerful web-based organization talent will help you to make your daily work easier by providing you the opportunity to manage appointments, contacts, documents, files, links, electronic mailboxes, access data, etc. in a well arranged form. A modular system allows Personal WebBase to expand. Since the module structure is very simple, also inexperienced PHP developers are able to simply create their own components.
